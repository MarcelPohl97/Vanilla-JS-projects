After Project is stable and running think about adding a Monthly simple review data on how much you worked out (make with canvas)

- 14.04.2020 Tasks:
    -> after clicking on a date workout and food are coming in from 2 sides and are 50% width and split once u hover over something,
        it gets a little wider if u click on it it reduces width to 0 again and shows the picked tracker
    -> add a button to go back to the tracked options
    -> add dummy data to the pages 
    -> once everything works start working on the queries


- Bugfixes Cleanups:
    -> Fix clicking the specific day gets an object
