- Todos:
- setup UI background:
- things to add:
    - at the beginning question what is your goal of drinking today? (design background blurry little input with button)
    - app calculates the height and percentages through that (design change from inspiration we put a goal on top)
    - button in bottom middle once you press on that background goes a littler darker and you have different options to choose
    - after click it calculates how much percentage is left we do that by using vh example : height is 100vh we minus that by a bit
    - since the waves start under the start calculation
    - we use a time changer when its a new day it always asks you how much you want to drink today since we wont be using any backend
    - we will be using local storage
    - once your at 100% water bubbles appear (canvas)
