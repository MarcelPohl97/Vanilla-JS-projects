App Vision:   
-> room create/ search funcionality with password protection
-> when adding a cart people can see who created it
-> brain storming is also based on the value in the database so everybody can see the cards floating around at the same time
-> card delete functionality
-> card update functionality(x, y and text)

-> add a fancy animation when aligning them

-> room search functionality searches rooms that match up in alphabetical order for example: -> type in r every room that starts with r is first and so on


-> fix bug when element gets bigger and you have to calculate the bounce back animation
-> fix on mobile view screen and drag and drop maybe add preventdefault for a quick fix
-> fix for board view when switching between boards and relogging
-> fix for privacy settings not whole elemement clickable only free space
-> fix removing board view on user info when clicking the achievements

-> add drag realtime update
