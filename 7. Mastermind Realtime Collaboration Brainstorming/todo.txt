App Vision: 

-> fix not draggable bug
-> make input have full width at mobile view

-> deploy app and test in mobile
-> clean up js code and comment out

High Bugfixes for usability:
-> maybe theres a away to calculate the current position of a card through the actualy width of a screen
-> fix bug when element gets bigger and you have to calculate the bounce back animation/ when element is saved at 900px and someone reopens in mobile its bugged
(find a away to replace the elements)

Medium Bugfixes for better usability:
-> fix for board view when switching between boards and relogging
-> fix for privacy settings not whole elemement clickable only free space
-> fix removing board view on user info when clicking the achievements

Low Bugfixes better for usability:
-> add a "Do you really want to delete this card question"
-> room search functionality searches rooms that match up in alphabetical order for example: -> type in r every room that starts with r is first and so on
-> room with password protection functionality
-> different animations or movements when brainstorming
-> maybe fix when card gets back to his original position it doesnt start there anymore unless you rejoin the room it keeps brainstorming in the coords it stopped
but maybe fixable when animations might come in place and cards start randomly anytime
-> add user stats

Implementation:
-> try to implement destructuring for data

-> Basic Value is the window with example: 1920px;
-> we want to work with percentages to use the app in all screensizes to get the positions through percentages
-> mathematical calculation example: user1: uses a screen of a width 1920px
                                     user2: uses a screen of a width 800px
                                     -> both should see all cards to let them both see the cards we need to convert the pixels into percentages so that for user1:
                                     the card at the coord 1600 is around 80%
                                     -> and for user2: 600 is around 80%
                                     -> we need to also calculate the whole 
-> first problem: load the cards percentage wise in
