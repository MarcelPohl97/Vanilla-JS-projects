App Vision: 

-> frontend for room search/create
-> after you login window closes and room search shows up, same with register you register and automatically login
-> find a way to get UID to add to user database to get name and stuff
-> database design for rooms incÃ¶uding cards
-> room create/ search funcionality with password protection
-> Join room functionality and loading data (cards)
-> when adding a cart people can see who created it
-> brain storming is also based on the value in the database so everybody can see the cards floating around at the same time


-> add a fancy animation when aligning them




-> fix bug when element gets bigger and you have to calculate the bounce back animation
-> fix on mobile view screen and drag and drop maybe add preventdefault for a quick fix

-> add drag realtime update
