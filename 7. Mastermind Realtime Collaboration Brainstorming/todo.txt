App Vision:
-> update cards when they are brainstorming (try to find a way that they dont update in realtime but after the brainstorm is stopped they all position at a certain place)
-> brain storming is also based on the value in the database so everybody can see the cards floating around at the same time
-> card text update
-> card delete functionality
-> room create/ search funcionality with password protection


-> add a fancy animation when aligning them
-> room search functionality searches rooms that match up in alphabetical order for example: -> type in r every room that starts with r is first and so on


-> fix bug when element gets bigger and you have to calculate the bounce back animation
-> fix on mobile view screen and drag and drop maybe add preventdefault for a quick fix
-> fix for board view when switching between boards and relogging
-> fix for privacy settings not whole elemement clickable only free space
-> fix removing board view on user info when clicking the achievements
