(find a away to replace the elements
-> fix crossbrowser compatibility
-> make input have full width at mobile view

Medium Bugfixes for better usability:
-> fix for privacy settings not whole elemement clickable only free space


Low Bugfixes better for usability:
-> add a "Do you really want to delete this card question"
-> room search functionality searches rooms that match up in alphabetical order for example: -> type in r every room that starts with r is first and so on
-> room with password protection functionality
-> different animations or movements when brainstorming
-> maybe fix when card gets back to his original position it doesnt start there anymore unless you rejoin the room it keeps brainstorming in the coords it stopped
but maybe fixable when animations might come in place and cards start randomly anytime
-> add user stats

Implementation:

-> try to implement destructuring for data
